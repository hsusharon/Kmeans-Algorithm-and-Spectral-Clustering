The objection of this mini project is to compare the result between Kmeans algorithm and Spectral clustering
We cluster the data into 2,4,8 different clusters.
And we are also able to show that optimal clustering method depends on the dataset. 

Run main.m to generate 12 figures that classifies the data into multiple classes.
Use the cost function to calculate each classification method.
